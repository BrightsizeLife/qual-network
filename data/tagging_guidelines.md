# Dimension Tagging Guidelines

## Scale (0-3)
- **0**: Absent / Not mentioned
- **1**: Briefly mentioned or implied
- **2**: Discussed with some detail
- **3**: Central theme, extensively discussed

## Tips
- Focus on explicit content; avoid over-inference.
- When in doubt between adjacent levels, round down.
- Consult examples in training materials.

## Edge Cases
- Sarcasm or negation: code the literal semantic content.
- Multiple mentions: aggregate to highest applicable level.
